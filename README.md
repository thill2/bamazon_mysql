# bamazon_mysql
In this assignment I'm using **Node.js and MySql** to create an Amazon-like storefront. The app will take in orders from customers, deplete stock from the store's inventory, and display the purchase price of the selected items. 
This app requires the following **npm packages:** *prompt, inquirer, & mysql.*  

Because the javascript file is looking for a local database, the code won't immediately work when downloaded unless you recreate a similar "bamazon_db" and "products" table on your local machine.  For this reason, screenshots are included to show the app's functionality.
